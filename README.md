# CoinChangeProblem

####Java Implementation - Dynamic Programming Coin Change

Objective: Given a set of coins and amount, Write an algorithm to find out how many ways we can make the change of the amount using the coins given.

This is another problem in which i will show you the advantage of Dynamic programming over recursion.

Example:

Amount = 5

coins [] = {1,2,3}

{1,1,1,1,1} {1,1,1,2}, {1,2,2}, {1,1,3} {2,3}

Number of ways to make change = 5

Minimum no of coing to make change = 2
